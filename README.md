The colour scheme is based of the exact blue, white and yellow from the Leeds United Football Club Logo
Here are some of the major points in this design as well as majority of issues faced along the way:
Banner Test 2 – Heading was stuck behind the navbar
Banner Test 3 – Implemented proper CSS code for the banner, no improvement 
Banner Test 4 – Changed the navbar to be unfixed to the top, inspired by Leeds - What you need to know before you go - Go Guides (hotels.com), attempted to use an image banner in the CSS file, unsuccessful
(Nov 11th) Banner Test 5 – Image implemented, with no structure/formatting at all
(Nov 14th) Banner Test 6 (Also, but inaccurately names Banner Test 5) - Banner implemented, with improper height calibration, link to personal CCS link made, banner switched from .jpg > .png
Banner Commit 7 – Banner is now a collage and appropriately sized
NavBar Divs – All NavBar elements are organised by left, right and centre. Banner image also altered to match Leeds united colours, background to be #1D428A
NavBar Divs 2 _ Navbar colour set to #ffffff, left text set to the built-in class “navbar brand”
Header Implementation – Header added, with formatting the wrong colour and too close to the banner
Background Change 1 – Set background to be #1D428A, however as banner image is imported, the background varied from it’s version of #1D428A
Background Change 2 – True colour found
Index.html, Text Placeholder – Header and introductory paragraph have been properly formatted 
All Pages and Links – Every page now created (attractions.html and history.html as of now) and all links successfully lead to one another, although all are copies of one another.
Map Formatting – Map added and properly placed with use of Bootstrap’s grid system, also featurette dividers were added to separate features
Footer - All pages now have an identical footer marking the end of the page 
History Template – Although now proper content has been filled, the main structure is set for the History page, potential to swap still images for automatic carousels where it is called for
Content Split 7:5 – Content is now split in the given ratio for the attractions page
Card Test 1 – First use of card on the attractions page was a success
Card Test 2 – All Cards with correct images in place and in proper ratio
Content – Majority of content put in
